*<center> <h1>Interpreted vs Compiled Programming Languages </h1> </center>*



## **What's the Difference?**

When we need a source code converted in to a machine code before it can run, there are 2 ways to do this: 
 

**<center> 1. Compiled:**

Is when you have a source code and you use a compiler to convert it to machine code to be executed but canâ€™t see the source code  

**2. Interpreted:**

 Is when it creates a copy of the source code and  interpreter program like a web browser reads line by line of the source code and interprets it

##  **What language should I use?**
---
More than choosing, we need to take in consideration the advantages and disadvantages of each. 


### **<center> 1. Compiled:**</center>

 **Advantages**  
<ul>
  <li>Faster execution</li>
  <li>Source code private</li>
</ul>



**Disadvantages**

<ul>
  <li>Additional time needed to complete the entire compilation step before testing </li>
  <li>Not cross-platform</li>
</ul>

### **<center>2. Interpreted:**</center>
**Advantages** 
<ul>
  <li>Tend to be more flexible, cross-platform</li>
  <li>Simpler to test</li>
</ul>

**Disadvantages**

<ul>
  <li>Source code is public </li>
  <li>Execution speed compared to compiled languages</li>
</ul>

## **Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?**
---

Yes, a Java first compile into Bytecode which JRE can understand. ByteCode is then **interpreted** by the JVM making it as interpreted language too.
