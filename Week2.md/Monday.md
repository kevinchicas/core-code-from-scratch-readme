There's not challenges for this day but we have learned about:

- [if...else](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)
---

The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. If the condition is falsy, another statement in the optional else clause will be executed.

- [for](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) 
---

The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop.


- [while](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)
---
The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.

- [functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)
---
The function declaration (function statement) defines a function with the specified parameters.

You can also define functions using the Function constructor and a function expression.
